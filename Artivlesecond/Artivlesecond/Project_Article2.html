			<h1>10 Diseases can be cured by Yoga</h1>
			<p>
				Yoga is an Indian art form which is more than a mere type of exercise or way of breathing. If medicines have failed you, yoga might not disappoint you. It actually boasts an impressive plethora of physical benefits suitable for all groups and can be used as complementary therapy in combination with conventional treatments for various diseases. Even though yoga aims to rejuvenate the body from within, be sure to consult a physician before attempting a yoga regimen in order to identify any limitations that may perhaps result in an injury.
